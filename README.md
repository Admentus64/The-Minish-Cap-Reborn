- WARNING! -

The ROM this repository builds cannot be 'shifted', primarily due to some hardcoded pointers which have yet
to be dumped. Thus this repository is currently in an experimental and research phase and cannot yet be used
traditionally as a source code base for general changes.
```

This is a WIP decompilation of The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap.
The purpose of the project is to recreate a source code base for the game from scratch, using information found inside the game along with static and/or dynamic analysis.

It builds the following ROMs:

* [**tmc.gba**](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=show_record&s=23&n=1841) `sha1: b4bd50e4131b027c334547b4524e2dbbd4227130`
* [**tmc_eu.gba**](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=show_record&s=23&n=1734) `sha1: cff199b36ff173fb6faf152653d1bccf87c26fb7`
* [**tmc_jp.gba**](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=show_record&s=23&n=1719) `sha1: 6c5404a1effb17f481f352181d0f1c61a2765c5d`
