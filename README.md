- WARNING! -

This repository is a work in progress, and while it can be used to make certain changes, it's still
constantly evolving. If you use it for modding purposes in its current state, please be aware that
the codebase can drastically change at any time. Also note that some parts of the ROM may not be
'shiftable' yet, so modifying them could be difficult at this point.

This is a WIP decompilation of The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap.
The purpose of the project is to recreate a source code base for the game from scratch, using information found inside the game along with static and/or dynamic analysis.

It can target the following ROMs:

* [**tmc.gba**](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=show_record&s=23&n=1841) `sha1: b4bd50e4131b027c334547b4524e2dbbd4227130`
* [**tmc_jp.gba**](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=show_record&s=23&n=1719) `sha1: 6c5404a1effb17f481f352181d0f1c61a2765c5d`
* [**tmc_eu.gba**](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=show_record&s=23&n=1734) `sha1: cff199b36ff173fb6faf152653d1bccf87c26fb7`
* [**tmc_demo.gba**](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=show_record&s=23&n=x051) `sha1: 63fcad218f9047b6a9edbb68c98bd0dec322d7a1`

**Note:** This repository does not include any of the assets necessary to build the ROM.
A prior copy of the game is required to extract the needed assets.
